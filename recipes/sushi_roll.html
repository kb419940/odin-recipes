    <h1>Crab Sushi Rolls</h1>    
    <img src="sushi_roll.png" alt="">
    <p>This crab sushi roll with imitation 
        crabmeat recipe is delicious and surprisingly 
        simple to make. Sushi is expensive to buy at 
        the supermarket, so making your own will save 
        you tons of money. My husband is a sushi freak! 
        I make this for him all the time.</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>¼ cucumber, peeled and sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 pieces imitation crab legs</li>
        <li>½ (3 ounce) package cream cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in rice vinegar and salt. Allow to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Lay out seaweed sheets. Moisten hands with water, then spread cooled rice evenly on each sheet, leaving a 1/2-inch gap along one edge, lengthwise. Arrange strips of cucumber, imitation crabmeat, and cream cheese on top of the rice in a straight line along the side opposite the gap. Roll up sushi from the toppings to the seaweed sheet's exposed end.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp wet knife, slice each roll into 5 or 6 pieces. Serve with minced ginger on the side.</li>
    </ol>
